# ITPR6.590 - Test Plan

## Introduction 
### Objective
    This Document has been established to describe the testing requirements and outcomes of the project  
    “Crazy Treasure Maze”.  
    The intention of this document is to detail and outline the process that the testing and development  
    team will follow for this project to obtain the desired outcomes.

### Project Overview
    This project is to develop and test a console application “Crazy Treasure maze”.  
    The concept of this application is to navigate a player (student) through a ten by ten  
    matrix (rooms), the end goal is to locate a hidden treasure that is randomly placed in one  
    of the rooms that make up the matrix.  
  
    During the quest the player will need to avoid encountering a sprit (ghost), If the student  
    occupies the same room as the ghost the game will end informing the player of the end  
    of game. If the ghost moves to a room that dose not contain another room next to it the  
    player will be alerted buy text that the ghost was heard bumping into a wall.  
    If the player is in a room that is next to the ghost, text shell let the player know that they  
    can hair coins falling on the floor.  
  
     A sprit (Treasure Goblin) will be placed at random in one of the rooms. The Treasure  
    goblin will be hidden and non-visible to the player, if the player is in a room a Jasion to  
    the room the treasure goblin is in, the player will be warned via text that they hear  
    somebody mumbling about the treasure. If the player lands in the same room as the  
    treasure goblin and not the treasure the player will lose the game. To win the game the  
    player will need to have encountered the treasure and the treasure goblin in that order.  
  
### Scope
    The scope of this test plan is to test the functional requirements for the application  
    “Crazy Treasure Maze”. The test plan will define the requirements of how to test that  
    The application meets all the required outcomes, it will document and outline the  
    individual procedures for unit testing at the base level. Test plan will not test for any  
    discrepancies with the tests them salves, nor will it test the programming language or its  
    pre-built libraries, it will not test the systems that it is released on for performance or  
    efficiency issues.  
  
### Constraints 
    A lack of time and staffing for this project dictates the limitations on the testing and its  
    Procedures, the lack of a pair reduces the ability to pair review the testing outcomes  
    allowing for discrepancies that may otherwise be caught and reviewed. With the lack of a  
    pair the time taken to produce the desired tests may take longer and affect the date that tests are completed.

    The requierments for the developer to complecte the testing of this application will be as follows:  
* Develope testing requierment.
* Develope a testing plan.
* Document any assuptions and possible issues with Application.
* Keep a error/issue log of any issues that occure during and after development.
* Develop Application.
* Development of unit tests,
* Conduct and record unit test resolts.
* Summiting final report to client By the 8 june.
